## How it works

The 3 input pins can be used to decide which of the 6 letters should be displayed.
The logic circuit then converts the input into specific letters.

"000 = M"<br/>
"001 = a"<br/>
"010 = r"<br/>
"011 = v"<br/>
"100 = i"<br/>
"101 = n"<br/>

## How to test

Simply enter a 0 or 1 on the first 3 pins and connect the output to a 7-segment display. 

## External hardware

Only switches for the input and a 7-segment display as output
