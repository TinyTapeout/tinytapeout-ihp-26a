## How it works
This is a simple puzzle game where your goal is it to get the seven segment display to display all the numbers from 0-9.
Flipping an input always toggles a corresponding segment and all neighboring segments.

## How to test
Connect microswitches to i0 to i6 and connect the seven segment display to o0-o6 (the dot of the display isn't used if it has one)

## External hardware

- seven segment led display
- seven microswitches
